        description: "Communities Against Corona is a responsive website that is designed to create a platform for communities to reach out to each other and help them by offering extra resources they might have such as toilet paper, water, food, etc. Users of the website can place markers on the map and can indicate what resources they are able to provide. They can also add a label to the markers with information such as their name, phone number, address and a short description. Users can modify their markers and see that their changes are deployed in real-time to all users currently logged in.",

        description: "We created a website called HelpingHand that helps homeless people connect with those willing and able to help them. The volunteers can mark events at their location on a map for food or shelter. Then, people in need can access this list of locations and get directions to the events, food and shelters. Because this was a project we did in our first hackathon and because it was our first time dabbling with web applications and Leaflet Maps API, we are not able to fully implement our vision for the website. However, I am proud that we are able to work together as a team and learn new scripting languages in order to at least create a prototype. ",

        description: "This was the final project we did for AP:CSA. We used Java to recreate the beloved Connect 4 game. We used Eclipse and its window builder plugin to create the UI for this project. Early on, We decided to make a connect four class that would have an array of 1's and 0's to represent the players' coins. The Gui would then reference this class to do all of its functions such as adding coins and determining the winner.I really enjoyed working on this project as it showed the practical potential of Java. I realized I could use Java to make all kinds of apps and games and not just for random algorithmic problems. ",
